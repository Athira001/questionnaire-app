## A Sample Questionnaire Web App Using React 

 **A small web application that enables a user to answer a questionnaire.**
- The questionnaire is based on a JSON (`src/data/questionnaire.js`) that the frontend uses to drive the questions. 
- Currently, we are supporting `input` (types as text, email, radio, etc) and `textarea` tag. 
- The user can go back to a previous question without losing the answers have given in a current question
- Followed Mobile-First Approach 
- Using animation 
- Support tests
